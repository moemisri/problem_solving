By committing solutions to this repository regularly, you can keep track of your progress over time, refer back to previous solutions, and showcase your problem-solving abilities to potential employers or collaborators.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:moemisri/problem_solving.git
```

### 2. Create a New Branch

Before working on a new problem, create a new branch to separate the changes:

```shell
git checkout -b new-problem-solution
```

### 3. Solve a Problem

Inside the repository, create a new directory for the problem you are going to solve. Name the directory descriptively, preferably with the problem's name or a brief description.

```shell
mkdir problem-name
cd problem-name
```

### 4. Implement the Solution

Write the solution code in a programming language of your choice. You can include the solution in a single file or organize it into multiple files if necessary. Add any supporting files or resources related to the problem in this directory.

### 5. Test the Solution

Create test cases to verify the correctness of your solution. Add a test suite or individual test files to ensure that your solution handles various input scenarios correctly. Run the tests to validate your solution.

### 6. Commit and Push

Once you are satisfied with your solution, commit the changes and push them to your repository:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Add solution for problem-name"
git push origin new-problem-solution
```

### 7. Repeat

Repeat steps 3-6 for each new problem you want to solve daily. Create separate branches and directories for each problem, ensuring clear separation and organization.
